Rules for the data in polar files:
1)     One windspeed curve per line.
2)     The curves must be listed in increasing order of windspeed.
3)     There must be a least 3 points per curve.
4)     There must be at least one non-zero windspeed curve.
5)     In each line, the TWA's must be increasing down the list.
6)     The minimum TWA is zero, and the maximum is 180.
7)     The 2nd TWA in a line is the best VMG upwind angle for that windspeed.  The 2nd to last TWA is the best VMG downwind angle for that windspeed
8)     The first TWA should be less than any 2nd TWA in any curve.  Ideally, zero.
9)     The last TWA should be greater than any 2nd-to-last TWA in any curve.  Ideally, 180
